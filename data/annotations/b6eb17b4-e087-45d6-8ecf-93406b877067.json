And then other times you drive through the town and you realize that man is places bigger than [LAUGHS] it needs to be because and it is funny because people it's like we got we got a Walmart, and Kroger decided to go move in, put in a Kroger. And there were people in his town that were just absolutely raising all kinds of static about having another grocery store. And I mean, he goes, Hey, man is different. Good golly, give somebody else a choice. You know, not everybody likes to shop at Walmart or Brookshires. But, you know, it's just politics. [INAUDIBLE] a small town.

Working with my job as a carpenter. And I stayed out. When I graduated high school, I thought to myself, Man, I will I want to get out of this one horse town. At that time, there was one red light in the middle of town. And I just don't I want to get out of this one horse town get to big city, and just not ever come back. And I moved.

And we know that we're a little more expensive. But I've seen, I've taught my son well. And he's a better carpenter than I am.

And there's, it's a good economy here in this town. And, you know, people work hard, and they it's amazing is like me and my wife.

And they, we feel a lot of people in town feel like they're just looked for ways to spend our tax money. And I mean, it's like, you know, we're, we've always been a pretty meager town. And I know, we grow with the times. But I mean, you know, our, our little city hall and everything. They're building one now that is this huge building. And, you know, everybody's kind of going like, man, do we really need to city hall that big, but then it you know, it's a mixed bag being bad and good, because you're gonna get a huge city hall, the taxpayers are paying for it. But we've got a public library in it. And it's gonna be a big library, you know. And, you know, I think it's great because that gives people that hadn't got access to computers and stuff. And it gives them a chance to go in there and educate yourself or, you know, read a book or you know, in like, say it's count, it's pro and con, there are some things that are good about it. And there's some things that are bad about it. The only other bad thing that I would say about it is the fact that and this this is just my age, telling off on me is the fact that we're growing way too fast. I mean, it's like three years ago when we had the big ice storm. Uh, me and my wife and my sister in law, and my niece and my mother in law, we were all camped out in this house because nobody had electricity. And we had a gas stove and [LAUGHS] I brought the barbecue grill in here, in the middle of the living room, it lit that thing. And we burned the stove. And we had electric heaters in some of the bedrooms, my wife's room. And, you know, it was just because the infrastructure was just, we had rolling blackouts. And you wasn't supposed to be without power for more than about eight or nine, maybe 10 hours. And we were without power for three or four days. And being a carpenter and the projection of this, this area is that they're there, the next 10 years. They're planning on building 400 houses a year. So it's 400 families. And that's supposed to be the trend for the next 10 years. So let's, oh boy, my math is terrible right now. So 10 times 400, that's 40,000 or 4000. "

You know, there there are companies out there that would come in and build $150,000 houses if they could. But you know, our city fathers and stuff all \"Well, that'll attract the criminal element because I got these substandard houses.\" Well, I live in a substandard house tell me this. I've got 1800 square feet that's [LAUGHS] in I work on houses and stuff got five 5000 6000 8000 square feet. And you know, and it just amazes me shocked me sometimes that you know what? The value of things has gone up so much. I mean this, this lot, I live on the corner a lot. And when me and my wife bought this lot, my brother we have next door. And I got another brother that lives, four houses down and across the street. And we thought it was cool that all of us get back on the same street, we had a farm that we lived down, whose kids and grew up on. And we kind of got scattered into the winds. And then um, three of us got back together, we lost one brother in a plane crash. But, uh, we all stay connected with each other and we were able to do that. And I don't know of any other. You know, it's I'll meet people. If I'm rambling, I'm sorry, but I meet people in my walk through life. And you know, I just you know, they'll get to be talking about their best friend.

You know, there used to be a lot of country that you could drive back roads and drink beer and never see anybody for hours. And now it's, I mean, it's a solid city.

And there's a little bit of country between here and [DIFFERENT NORTH TEXAS REGION COMMUNITY NAME], and from the [DIFFERENT NORTH TEXAS REGION COMMUNITY NAME] to [WEST TEXAS REGION COMMUNITY NAME] is almost solid cities. And same way going north and south. You know, there's just little stretches of country and just, you know, and it's just gonna grow, it's just gonna get bigger and bigger, more stores, more houses. You know, I guess it's progress. But you know, old guys like me is sometimes it's too much progress. "

              "text": "Oh, well, it's it's been great. You look it was like say we've when me and my son started working here local. Uh, we met, we got out and we searched for the con- to general contractors to put our name in the box to \"Hey, y'all call us if you need something?\" You know, and then we got lucky because well, \"How long have y'all lived here?\" \"Well, I've lived here you know,\" when I tell I lived here 50 years. And you know, in my son has been here basically all his life. And \"Okay, we like local boys\" and so we it it has helped us as far as you know, like I say it me and my wife. We try to keep things local in what we do. You know, it's there's, you know, we go out to eat with family and stuff. And I mean, there's lots of great restaurants in [DIFFERENT NORTH TEXAS REGION COMMUNITY NAME] and [DIFFERENT NORTH TEXAS REGION COMMUNITY NAME] and [DIFFERENT NORTH TEXAS REGION COMMUNITY NAME]. And we eat here in [COMMUNITY NAME] to give our money and our business to the fellow people in our town. You know, and there's and there's a lot of people that feel that way, you know, and do that. But, uh, as far as the, the, the how it's helped me as a carpenter, is there have been there's been times when is the little a widow woman over here. And I know she's on a fixed income. And I know she needs some carpet work done. And I get a call. \"What would you charge me to do this?\" And I go look at it. \"I can probably do this for about $700\" \"Ooh, that's high.\" \"Yes, ma'am.\" But I said, \"I'll tell you what I do. Can you pay me $300?\" \"Yeah, yeah, yeah.\" And to be honest with you, it's not that I'm losing money. It's just it, my hourly rate went down. But you got to do what's right. And sometimes you got to take a hit. It helps somebody out over here. And, you know, and then that's, that's kind of paying it forward type thing. Cause, you know, someday it may happen to me that I, you know, I'm gonna fixed income and I need some help. I ain't got the money to do it. And but I know, the trust in God did take care of us, they always had, we, we've been through some really hard stuff with losing family members and stuff like that. And we know that, man, we've had a lot of God, things hit us right in the face. And man, that was God helping us out, you know, you know, and that's another thing about this town. I mean, when I was in high school, we had one high school, we probably had about 20 churches. So and everybody went to church. And so it was, it was pretty religious. You know, there's a lot of religious upbringing, you know, in here in this town, and I think it's a good thing. Because it's like, I don't go to church anymore. But I went to church up until the time I was 19. And I'm 60, fix be 69. So let's be in 50 years. But the older I get the closer to the Creator, become and my faith, get stronger, that I know what awaits me, or I've got a faith in what awaits me. And I'm not ready to go tomorrow. But I'm not scared of when this happens. You know, and that's, you know, and that's, that's another good thing about coming from a small town, small community, is the fact that you can do this, it's you, you get to know your neighbors, and you get to trust them. And I mean, I've worked with people up in [DIFFERENT NORTH TEXAS REGION COMMUNITY NAME], that I've, you know, I'm working on their house now been there about two, three months and you know, just in conversation. \"Man, how are you neighbors, got good neighbors?\" \"Well, I don't know.\" \"What do you mean, you don't know? They live right next door to you.\" \"Oh, yeah. But we don't talk to them.\" \"How long they live there?\" \"Oh, we live beside each other for 15 years. You know, we'd wave and say hi, and that's about it.\" Man. That's once you go over, talk to them across the fence, man strike up conversation. You know, this is just weird, you know? And, I don't know. Let's say I'm a dinosaur, I love being a dinosaur. And, uh, I like coming from a small town. In fact, I'm proud of that fact that I come from this town and I used to hate this town. You know, your perspectives change and, you know, you grow up and you realize that the this place ain't as bad as I thought it gonna be. "

And then when I graduated high school, uh, I was gonna join the Navy and because my dad was a Navy man, and I thought \"Boy, he'd be proud of me for joining the Navy.\" He's \"Oh, no, no, no, no.\" Because I had a brother went to Vietnam. And I graduated. The wars had been was ending. And so in Vietnam, it was over with and he then you brother, you mama went crazy. When you brothers go on with worried about him, and you're the baby of the family. I don't want you to put me through. [LAUGHS] So my dad had been his partner and he got me in the carpenters union in Dallas. And basically I got a bachelor's degree in carpentry served out in the apprenticeship, one school for four years. And I never looked back. It's to me it's a honorable trade. I mean, you stop and think about it. What did Jesus do to make living? He was carpenter. You know, he was construction, damn construction worker [LAUGHS] is, you know, you just I just, you know, and it's one of those things too that I'm proud of the fact of what I do, I build houses. Because of me people can move into a house and start a new life. And I look at it that way. You know, that? Yeah. I have done something to help the community building houses here. And you know, I just don't know, it's, it's, it's, it's kind of just a big circle, like big wheel that goes round and round. And you know, the mess. That's what I like to say, a swirl early loop about this town, is fact that all almost I say 99% of the people that everybody will try to take care of you. You know, if if you're down. I mean, we had we just had a friend of ours did, had a tornado hit his trailer house. And he's got wife, two little kids. And I mean, they lost it, it just tore his down to the ground, scattered out in pastures. And we got involved with helping them rebuild. And I mean, within a day or two, we'd found em a place to live. got them involved with the church, helping them, you know, [LOCAL CHARITY] and all of this stuff, and helping them get back on their feet. And two weeks later, they were better off. My my friend, he told me, he's meant we're better off than we've ever been in our life. Because you guys, when he met, I just don't understand how you reach out to people, like I said, it's really easy. You do what's right, you know, like I say. See, that's just part of the values that I grew up with. I had two great, amazing parents that instilled that in me and my brothers. I mean, there was four of us. And ain't nobody went to jail. You know, we knew better, you know, not a bad, not a bad one and a bunch. And we made our mistakes. And we, I mean, they, I spent the night in a jail cell couple of times, but never was arrested. Because I was best friend with the chief of police's son [LAUGHS]. And so it was a he get in a car and we'll take you to a bed. And he'd take me down in jail, and we'd drink coffee and eat doughnuts he had happened twice in one year. They said don't don't make me pull you over again. If I do. There will be a record and I didn't you know is okay, I'll straight up. Now quit drinking. [LAUGHS] "

And my mother would actually pack me lunch because she knew that I ain't coming in, and she would pack me lunch. And we're gonna go out and play. And you know, and like I say I had three big brothers. And there wasn't anybody for miles to play with except ourselves. You know. And, you know, I think that that kind of growing up, it there have been times that me and my brothers disagree. But because of being that close with each other, growing up, it gives us a sense of dedication by my mom and dad. It was, you know, okay. You may not like each other. But by God, you better love each other. Whether you like them or not, you better love better stand up. It's like if one of us come home with a black eye. Well, what happened to you got in a fight at school? And he looked at the other brothers and go, where's your black eye? He better all come home with a black eye .

You know, it is simply because I think it's just simply because we're so crowded, there's so many people around, and you don't have time we're caught up going to work, going to the store doing this doing it. And you get caught up in your life. And you haven't got the time to get to know people. You know, and that's a shame. You know, and it's not just this town, it's the world. And, you know, it's a shame that, like, say, you, I think that every kid growing up ought to be able to grow up in the country, because country life and country living and we had a we were, we were poor. But we had cows that we had people, some of our neighbors that didn't have a couple of dairy cows. And then we had store bought milk, dad had a job and mom, go store and buy just anything we needed. But I mean, it's like, we had beef cows. And our freezer'd be full of beef, sirloin, steamed bones, you know, just everything there is. But there was times we couldn't afford steak sauce. You know, and, but we had neighbors that were they, I mean we might have been a little poor. These people were dirt poor. You know, it's just in, [STAMMERING] my mother would go, she told the neighbor lady, she said, \"Well, you know, me and my kids, we like farm fresh milk. And if y'all have any extra, I'll trade you for it.\" So my mother bartered with them. And we were on a barter system. Because these are proud people, they would know you ain't given me nothing. I will trade you, you know, you're gonna give me this, I'm gonna give you something. And that's what they would do. They would give us farm fresh milk from their cows. And they'll pasteurize and then process in bowls and stuff, good. But that's the kind of thing that went on. You took care. You know, like say they they were dirt poor. And your mom and daddy instilled this kind of thing, uh, I come through. When I went to school, we were segregated. Black kids went to one school, white kids went to another school. My first friends and playmates, besides my brothers was there was three little black kids that lived about half a mile down the road from us. And my dad was a he is a carver, but he was a mechanic electrician and plumber. He could do it all jack of all trades. And he always made sure that we either had bicycles, or mini bikes, or he bought a car wanted to make a dune buggy out of just drive around farm in. And he would let me him to mama would let me take my mini bike and drive to these three little boys' house. And we played. Their mom and dad lived in a barn. You could see daylight through the cracks. And these people were real proud. And I grew up with these kids. And they were my friends and I can remember my school bus passing em. They're outside road waiting for the black bus. And I didn't get it. You know? And what school bus drive by. And I just in one day I just it just dawned on me \"Mama why don't they won't my school bus stop and pick them kids up because our school bus drives right by their school?\" So when I was about eight, maybe nine years old, my mother had to explain segregation to me. And even at that age that ain't effing fair. You know? And you know, and then of course, you know, we did when I was probably in about fifth grade, we desegregated and [CLAPS] blended into one school system. And it was one of the greatest things because, you know, there there, we had a, we had some racists, they had some racists, you know, you got white people who said, \"Screw me,\" you know, \"You black people out, screw me.\" And it's in the things that I grew up with. And that actually, that's part of the values that my mom and dad instilled in us is, you don't be prejudiced. You know, you judge people by their merit about what they can do and what they have done. And, you know, not just calls their religion, race and religion or color, you don't do that. You know, it's like, say it was this one of the greatest things. In my childhood, was the parents. I had instilled these values in me and I still got it now. Yeah. You know, and it's true. They were culture. There are bad apples in every bunch. But as a whole man, people are people. You know, it don't matter. You know, to meet a lot of people it does."

[CHUCKLES] And I don't, I don't stand in judgment of people that do because I've been an addict, you know. And uh there's programs out there though, that if you want to get off and quit, you get off quit. I walked away from it cold turkey. I just, my mother was my best friend in this life. And she could talk to me like my mother. And she could talk to me like my best friend. And when I realized I was 26 years old, and I realized I was out of control. Uh, I made a phone call to her. I justuh I just damn near died, damn near OD'd, you know, I made a phone call to her. And I said, \"Mom, I need some help.\" \"Well what do you need help for? What're you doin?\" \"Well, I'm out of control.\" \"Shoot, what do you mean you're out of control?\" I said um, \"Doing too much drinking, too much drugging\" and she's \"Pack you a suitcase, you come home tonight.\" And I did, and it's, it's an amazing, life is an amazing thing and an amazing journey. Uh, I moved back home when I was 26. And I got myself straight. And I worked hard at it. I just, that's it I quit. Uh, I lost my mother when I was 28. Is, like I say, to me, it took me a long time figuring out that was one the God things that that was God putting me back home. Because me and my mother become best friends. And we went and played bingo together. We went and hung out and you know, it's like quitting drinking. I didn't quit just all of a sudden it was okay still buying a case of beer. \"Let's go buy a 12 pack.\" And then it got to be \"Let's go buy a six pack.\" My mother liked beer too. But she drank two. Sometimes three. And, uh, you know, it's just she was she was one of my stoutest supporters. And I wanted to be, make her proud that I quit this. And especially when we found out that she had cancer and was going to lose her. I mean, there was no if ands or buts and boys, that was probably the hardest thing, that I've ever endured was burying my mother. My dad was tough to bury him. But my mother was tough as I was a mama's boy. But people asked me and I say \"My life's an open book, I will share my experiences with you. I will tell you the things I've done good I'll tell you the things I've done bad not all of them because they're, I've got skeletons and you do too. Nobody needs to know about that.\" [LAUGHS] But, you know, there's no use of lying about things. You know, it has another thing to do with actually living in this community. And with my mom and dad and with the closeness of our village when I was a kid you didn't lie because you're gonna get caught in it because everybody that you know my mother come up said you know when I got license. \"What do y'all do last night?\" I found out real quick. She already knew for what we done. And so after about the third time being called on the carpet and getting grounded from my car for lying. \"But what'd you do last night?\" \"Oh mom, you wouldn't believe I picked this girl up and in [lDIFFERENT NORTH TEXAS REGION COMMUNITY NAME]. We went to a motel God dang mama she was pretty.\" [LAUGHS] Start really getting into [LAUGHS] some explicits my mother and go, \"Okay, that's enough.\" Well you ask what I did last night. So you know, I'm gonna tell you the truth and I did you know. I've always been that way. You know? The only time I lied was to the cops and it was only to keep me going to jail. [BOTH LAUGHS] And when my wife tries on the new dress and she goes, \"Does this make me look fat\" sometimes? [LAUGHS] \"Yeah, it's no, honey it does not.\" [LAUGHS]  "

[DOOR CREAKS] When my mom died me and my dad becomes just like that together. I mean, we just, we've got all the stupid shit that we used to argue with. Pardon me. Stupid stuff. We used to argue over in I'll tell this story now and I'll quit talking. When I was 42 years old, and me and my wife been married a while with our boys up growing teenage. And my dad had been in my butt over something boy, he was chewing it talking to me like I was 12 years old. And boy I blew up, \"Dad quit treating me like I'm 12 I'm 42 years old and you standing there and he talking to me like that. I've had enough of it dad.\" And he stopped. And he looked at me and his mouth kind of fell open. Like he was in shock. And he said, \"Well, I guess you're right. I guess I have been treating you like yous 12 years old. Which I'll tell you what. I promise I will quit. If you'll do one thing for me.\" I was like \"What's that daddy?\" \"Quit acting like you're 12!\" [BOTH LAUGHS] You know, I looked at him and both of us busted out laughing and after that we never had we never had a bad day between us. You know? But that always felt it was funny. He was \"Quit acting like you're 12!\" I can't believe you said that. I mean, because I mean he's real stone faced you know? Which is it's after I have seriously thought sometimes I wished I could write a book.

One time we tied a rope to a limb of a cypress tree, and we'd swing out on a vine. In the spring I'd fly kites and on summer nights we'd catch fireflies, but we call them lighting bugs. Once in a while, we'd have fights with corn cobs or pine cones. In winter, we'd build a fire in the fireplace and pop popcorn and roast, peanuts and pecans. I guess I was a live wire. When I was 19 I went to work in Dallas, and Firestone Firestone Tire company. I didn't like city life and for a long time I'd go home every chance I got mama would always cook my favorite food fried okra, hoppin john that's rice and black eyed peas and pecan pie. We had lots of good times. But going home was not the same now. After Dad died, Momma has sold the farm moved to Tyler. I'd rather be living on the farm right now instead of here in city. But my wife and kids don't understand me when I gripe about city life and talk about moving to the country. My oldest child says Daddy, that's crazy. I'd just die if I had to live on a farm. Almost cried first time she said that. I know Texas is changing. But I try to make sure we don't lose touch with our roots. While we may live in a city, I want my kids to have a good feed, feeling for the land. Have a sense of place. Take pride in being Texans. And if they lose our ties to the land, the price of progress is too high. "
