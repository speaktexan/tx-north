And on the new items, like the {POPULAR ROUTE ASSOCIATION WITH THE COMMUNITY} stuff, everybody wants to have something that maybe their neighbors not selling near right down the street or something. So you looking for different and unique or you try to brand your own items and stuff like that. And for the pretty pretty much for the {PAUSE} our section of {POPULAR ROUTE ASSOCIATION WITH THE COMMUNITY}. I think we do really well because I don't sell books that I know uh {POPULAR ROUTE ASSOCIATION WITH THE COMMUNITY} related books that I know that they sell down the street.

Whatever the reason the trucks used to fit down the alleys and the alleys didn't shrink. So I mean, there's a few things like that, that it seems like and that refers back to somebody that came from {COMMUNITY NAME} or {NORTH TEXAS COMMUNITY} or {COMMUNITY NAME}, that maybe they don't have alleys. So they put the trash out in front of their houses.

That's one of the concerns. {LOCAL NEIGHBORHOOD NAME 1} is actually the worst as far as we have more rental property than we do homeowners. Um. So I know it's something that cities looking at and-and weighing, you know, how do you help? Or, but {STREET NOISE} it's also that um young people don't necessarily own anything, or as much as as their parents. Well, I mean, every, you know, we wanted a house, we wanted a car, we want, you know, your house needed-a lot of people want a toy, you know, their adult toys, boats, and scooters or whatever. And I don't see that in the new generation, they, you know, they want the minimal house they want, you know, a lot of them don't even want to drive and stuff, you know, and so, uh I yeah, I mean, it's, it's gonna, it's changing. I mean, it's already changed, and a lot of people don't uh take care of their elderly parents anymore. And that used to be something that every every family did, if you had an elder, you took care of them. And that would just with the increase in the nursing home. And so part of it is because maybe they're not capable of taking care of their parents or they don't live near their parents or, I mean um there's sure a lot of good reasons why it's not happening. But that is definitely something that changed over the last, you know, 30 or 40 years."

You didn't work as many hours you didn't have to work as young. And I think that's caused a big problem, especially with- our our children now, and then their children because there's a whole generation that wants-wants a lot for nothing. I mean, they don't want to work they don't wanna- They just they basically just want, they want what they want, but they don't want to have to earn it. And I think we're seeing a lot of that right now. And I think that's the consequence of our parents trying to love us so much and give us such a better a better life than they had and then. We- we continue that trend. And pretty soon now we have kids that don't want to do anything because we have-we don't expect anything of 'em.

It's a short made up story about life in Texas that was created in the 1980s. And since then, linguistic researchers have recorded a few hundred Texans reading it. They use these recordings as samples of people's standard way of speaking as they try to track how speech in Texas varies and changes over time.

I liked growing up in the country. When my chores were done, I wrote, I'd ride my worst climb trees or hike down to the creek to fish or swim. One time, we tied a rope to a limb of a cypress tree and we'd swing out wide over the swimming hole and drop into the water. I'd pretend- pretend to be Tarzan swinging on the vine. In the spring, I'd fly kites, and on summer nights, we'd catch fireflies, but we call them lightning bugs. Once in a while we would- We'd have fights with {PAUSE} cop- corncobs or pine cones. In the winter we'd build a fire in the fireplace and pop popcorn and roast peanuts and pecans. I guess I was a livewire. When I was 19 I went to work in Dallas in a Firestone Tire I store. I didn't like city life, and for a long time I go home every chance I got mama would always cook my favorite foods like fried okra hoppin john, That's rice and black eyed peas, and pecan pie. We had lots of good times, but going home is not the same now. After daddy died, Mama sold the farm and moved to Tyler. I'd rather be on a farm right now instead of here in the city. But my wife and kids don't understand me when I gripe about the city life and talk about moving to the country. My oldest child says \"daddy, That's crazy. I'd just die if I had to live on a farm.\" I almost cried the first time she said that. I know Texas is changing, but I try to make sure we don't lose touch with our roots. While we may live in the city, I want my kids to have a good feeling for the land, have a sense of place and take pride in being Texans. If they lose our ties to the land, the price of progress is too high. {BACKGROUND NOISE}"
