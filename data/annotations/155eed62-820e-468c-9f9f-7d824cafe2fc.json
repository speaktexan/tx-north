The- the country life is a little more simple than uh, you\nhad to make most decisions about. You have less input so you have people that are comfortable with\ntheir way of life um some people have built a house, one individual um spent a lot of money but to buy\nthe land and a house and um the business community came in and bought his land and is now building a big warehouse when he thought he was building in the country [LAUGHS] as it's kind odd, but we're\nthankful for the resources.

And so I was going to my computer career and I was offered a, a position because I\nhelped out a guy with some networking stuff. As I went off for training for three months, that tells you\nsomething. Uh-uh in-in Colle- in uh Chicago. And while I was there, that guy that got me the job left and\nwent to [OTHER IT COMPANY NAME], but [LAUGHS] uh.

I realized they haven't experienced that\nthey-so they have no idea um of what it's like to be a total winner just-. And so since I started being a\nfan in the 70s and they were always going to the playoffs they were always good. Won Super won\nSuper Bowls. So um and they were, we were a team of moral character and um and doing the right-\nthat's how they started. But as time went on, I think the meh, the probably most of the fans don't don't even care less they wuh-, as long as they win, they can do whatever they want. But that's not that's not\ngoing to stay that way. You know, you're not gonna, you need to look at good character people first.\nAnd then athletics."

I liked growing up in the country, when my chores were done,\nI'd ride my horse, climb trees or hike down to the creek to fish or swim. One time we tied a rope to a\nlimb of a cypress tree, and we'd swing out wide over the swimming hole and drop into the water. I'd\npretend to be Tarzan swinging on a vine. In the spring, I'd fly kites and on summer nights we catch fireflies. But we called them lightning bugs. Once in a while we'd have fights with corn cobs or pine\ncones. In the winter, we build a fire in the fireplace and pop popcorn and roast peanuts and pecans.\nPecans. I guess I would live there. I guess I was a live wire. When I was 19 I went to work in Dallas at a\nFirestone Tire store. I didn't like the city life. And for a long time, I'd go home every chance I got mama\nwould always cook my favorite foods fried okra. hoppin john, that's rice and black eyed peas, and\npecan pie. We had lots of good times, but going home is not the same now. After daddy died, Mama\nsold the farm and moved to Tyler. I'd rather be living on a farm right now instead of here in the city. But\nmy wife and kids don't understand me. And when I grip up about city life and talk about moving to the\ncountry my eldest child says \"daddy that's crazy I just die if I had to live on a farm\" I almost cried the\nfirst time she had said that. I know Texas is changing. But I tried to make sure we don't lose touch with\nour roots. While we may live in a city I want my kids to have a good feeling for the land, have a sense of\nplace, and take pride in being Texans. If they lose our ties to the land the price of progress is too high."
