Well, it didn't do that. They just built it on top of [PUBLIC TEXAS COLLEGE THAT NO LONGER EXITS]. Which in some ways a mistake not only because you don't have the county line thing and you don't really have a foot in Dallas County at all. And also a mistake because you inherited a lot of no offense here but Junior College faculty and put them in a senior college Well, Junior College faculty is simply not up to snuff senior college standards. So we you have a lot of what you would, many of us will call it dead wood faculty because he's someone pretty good in the classroom, but they weren't publishing anything. And once you're a senior college, you got to publish, publish or perish, publish or perish. It's just about it. But eventually they they die off and you hire a new faculty and then we did all right with it and [TEXAS PUBLIC COLLEGE] pretty good skin. But we missed out on the Dallas footing with that decision way back then. So we're in Tarrant County, a lot of students are from Dallas. We have a lot of commuter students from Fort Worth and Dallas.

              "text": "Well, I used to be deeply involved in the community actually, I was elected the democratic precinct chairman, and as well as the Election Judge, and you 1978 And I've served for whether it be from 1978 to 2020, whatever, that's 42 years as precinct chairman, in the Democratic Party and election judge overall, and I had a Republican ultimate running election, and we always got along. So was deeply involved in the political community. But even before seven, eight, soon as I got here, I went to I was politically involved in County conventions and such. So for a while, in the 80s, I was chairman of the Senate, state senate district, Democratic Party. When you go from the precinct that night on election day, well, it used to be done away with principles now. You elected people to the either to the county convention, or to the seat Senate District, this district. In rural counties, this is the county governments. They're all in one Senate District. Here we have senate districts go all over the place. So mine covered much of [NORTH TEXAS COMMUNITY] and much of southern [NORTH TEXAS COMMUNITY]. And I chaired that in the 1980s. And always at Jim Ryan speaking and Martin frost, I got to know, these guys governor's came up. They were Democrats back then. Except, well, Bill Clements was the editor. So I got to know state leaders too. I was also involved in the community. Well in Texas really is as well as the community in the labor movement, you know, writing a book on labor. But I did more than that I and 66, I got together with the head librarian at Uta, just the same semester, I arrived there and put it to them that we ought to create a Labor Archives and library, collect labor records, give the library some distinction. And he agreed with that. Most all libraries have an archives of some kind. And, of course, you got to build it around something. So we originally built it around labor. There was no other Labor Archives in the state. [FLAGSHIP TEXAS COLLEGE] had some labor records, but they weren't collecting them and they weren't doing anything, although they're preserving. Ruth Allen did that she was an economics professor at [FLAGSHIP TEXAS COLLEGE] 20s and 30s. And I got to know her in her old age and she gave some of her later records to us. So I went around the state frequently with sometimes with a couple other professors. And we collected we went into a town and we will collect the minutes of meetings of Central Labor councils, local unions, regional offices. Historic from Chicago said we had the only regional collection of the main colors union. Chicago has the national collection. They don't have any regional collections. So they came down here to research. So Robert Redford, Fort Worth was the center of a multi state regional office for the meat cutters union. They've since amalgamated with with a closed no with the what's the other one? Well, the butcher work I don't know a couple have emerged a lot of unions have merged. Anyway, we and we have lots of local union records and Central Labor Council meetings. written records Minister meeting of Central Labor Council is a meeting, usually monthly, countywide of all the unions in that county. So the Dallas County Central Labor Council Tarrant even dipped in for a while some smaller counties out of Austin, Travis County. Oh, and they're involved in politics and they're involved in organizing to facets of labor unions. You organize the unorganized if the authorities lets you and you engage in political campaigns and endorse candidates work for candidates. And I did some of that too, with usually with labor folks. Sometimes going door to door I prefer I prefer that to getting on a telephone. I wouldn't do a telephone calls are hard. Yeah. Yeah. Cool. Garcia. That's right. What a lot more. So I've been involved with the labor community and the political community. I know a lot of our youth no matter, politicians and labor leaders in this community and others, and I think it enlarged my vision of life. He didn't want to spend all my time among academics. And I treasured. But I treasure all those labor and political leaders. I met a lot of lawyers. Because lawyers are in the labor movement and in politics,"

Now that's eased under Biden. But whenever he got a Republican president, they put people on the National Labor Relations Board, who are anti labor, and you just can't get any organizing done. And even if you do organize, you can't get you can't get. You can't engage in collective bargaining in a meaningful sense, because management won't bargain.

And that I learned a little about their union back in the 60s. About I think what was more important in turning me on to labor was I attended the southern historical Convention, which meets annually. All of southern historians get together. manifestly was that year 66. And a number of the youngest or is there a couple of them from Florida State and buddies of mine, and others all around them all around the map together and called a little caucus. And we agreed to start a southern labor history wing of the Southern Historical Association. And there are other wings you have, you have a literary wing. And when you have these little subsets, they'll have some of their own programs at the southern historical convention. So you'll have a labor panel or two or three labor panels, meeting at different times a day. And other panels, political panels and social history panels and women's panel, minority panel. And some of them have their own organizations. So ours was labor, Southern labor. And we agreed at that meeting in, in Memphis, among ourselves to try to get local libraries in our institutions to collect labor. So that's why that's when I went back from that convention, to my head librarian and propose this, that we collect labor. And he and I just started doing, we drove out to United Auto Workers local, regional meeting, January 16. So that was our first trip. Now, he didn't make any more trips to hit the library to run. A couple of other professors helped me do that. And the guys in Atlanta did that Oh, wants to know, what was Georgia State, I guess it is or whatever, state universities in Atlanta, they started Labor Archives, after we did, and those two are still there. And still part of the, the archives and those two institutions. So it bore fruit at two universities. I don't know of any other southern Labor Archives, but but they're probably people at the University of Florida, for instance, and I know there are Chapel Hill in North Carolina, that have collected some labor records. And that may have been inspired in part by what we did. I mean, they, they know of our collections. So"

I liked growing up in the country. When my chores were done, I'd ride my horse, climb trees, or hike down to the creek to fish or swim. One time, we tied a rope to a limb of a cypress tree, and would swing out wide over the swimming hole and drop into the water. I'd pretend to be Tarzan swinging on a vine. In the spring, I'd fly kites and on summer nights we'd catch fireflies, but we call them lightning bugs. Once in a while we'd have fights with corn cobs or pine cones. In the winter, we'd build a fire in the fireplace and pop popcorn and roast peanuts and pecans. I guess I was alive wire. When I was 19 I went to work in Dallas at a Firestone Tire store. I didn't like the city life and for a long time I'd go home every chance I got mama would always good my favorite foods fried okra hoppin john, that's that's rice and black eyed peas. And pecan pie. We had lots of good times we're going home is not the same now. After daddy died, Mama sold the farm and moved to Tyler. I'd rather be living on a farm right now instead of here in the city. But my wife and kids don't understand we want to brag about city live and talk about moving to the country. My oldest child says Daddy, that's crazy. I just died how to live on a farm. I almost cried the first time she said that. I know Texas is changing. But I try to make sure we don't lose touch with our roots. While we may live in a city, I want my kids to have a good feeling for the land, have a sense of place and take pride in playing and being Texans. If they lose our ties to the land, the price of progress is too high"
