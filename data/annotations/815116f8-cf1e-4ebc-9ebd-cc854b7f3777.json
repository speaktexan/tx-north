Because he's uh- he looks like he's dead.\" [LAUGHS] So, so I, so she said, she went over there, and then I had called 911, and they were telling me to do uh mouth to mouth and stuff. And I told that nurse, I went back I said, they want you to do- -C, mouth and mouth on me. She goes, \"Honey, you can pry his mouth open with a crowbar. He's stiff.\" And so anyway, and all the carriers were laughing at me and aggravate me saying that he died waiting for his mail because I was so slow and, and then I had to sit and wait for the, for the uh coroner's office, because I found him. And they said, they said, \"Why don't you just throw them in the back of your Jeep and drop him off his [PERSON'S NAME]?\" Because I was delivering [PERSON'S NAME] mail at that time, you know, because I delivered Northside all the time.

It's a short made up story about life and Texas that was created in the 1980s. And since then, lingui- linguistic researchers have acquired a few 100 Texans reading it. They use these recordings as samples of people's standard way of speaking and then try to track how speech in Texas varies and changes over time. Would you be willing to read the passage out loud? "

When my chores were done, I'd ride my horse climb trees are hiked down the creek to visits or swim, to fish or swim, sorry. One time we try tied a rope to limb of a cypress tree and we swing out wide over the swimming hole and drop into the water. I pretended to be Tarzan swinging on the vine. In the spring I'd fly kites. On summer nights we'd catch fireflies, but we called them lightning bugs, so do we. Once in a while we would- we'd have fights with corn cubs are pine cones. In the winter we build a fire in the fireplace and pop popcorn and roast peanuts and pecans. I guess I was a livewire. When-When I was 19 I went to work in Dallas at Firestone Tire store. I didn't like the city life. And for a long time I'd go home every chance I got. Mama would always cook my favorite food, fried okra, Hoppin John, that's rice and black eyed peas, and pecan pie. We had lots of good times. But going home it wasn't the same now after Daddy died. Momma sold the farm and moved to Tyler. I'd rather be living on a farm right now, instead of here in the city, but my wife and my kids don't understand me when I gripe about the city live and talk about moving to the country. My oldest child says Daddy, that's crazy I'd just die if I had to live on a farm. I almost cried the first time she said that. I know Texas is changing, but I'm trying to make sure we don't lose touch with our roots. While we may live in the city, I want my kids to have a good feeling for the land. Have a sense of a place and take pride in being Texan. If they lose their- lose our ties to the land, the price of progress is too high. [PAPER FLIPS] "
