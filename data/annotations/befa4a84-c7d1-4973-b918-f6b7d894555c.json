So it's, it's\ngrown immensely since then, and everything has grown. Your, your wheat and corn fields have\ndisappeared and houses and businesses and things have popped up. The only town we had was here,\nthe original old downtown, which is just a town square, the main highway used to come through there,\nthere were no highways anywhere, um, and it went down [STREET NAME] used to be the highway\nhere. So it's, it's a very different, then they opened [HIGHWAY NAME]. And there were a little bit on it,\nbut not much, mainly a gas station, little place to eat, little insurance company, family, all of them family\nkind of places. And, uh, but that part of it seems to have grown immensely, you know, the population\ngrew. But from 1987, um, is about the time that it started. And I don't think any of us, you had in, uh, for\ninstance, in the City Hall that we had was downtown. It had the Fire Department with what vehicles we\nhave in it. It had the Tax Office, it had the Water Department, it had Finance, it had Public Works. It\nhad, not a Police Department, but a County Office there. Uh, it had the City Manager's little office, the\ncouncil room was in it. Every, we really didn't have Code back then, you know, they were getting that\nand they had to because of all the building that was beginning. You had to come up with code. I\nactually have my parents had a summer house in the lake, and they still didn't have codes there. So\nyou ended up having this beautiful palatial house and right beside it, there was a tire company, you\nknow, um, we had the foresight, I assume back then, to think of those things first, and otherwise, it\nmight have been very different than it is now. But that was town, there was nothing else. There was\nnothing else. The high school going in on [HIGHWAY NAME], in 1961. I'm part of a reunion group here.\nAnd it went it was built in 61. And there was like a few things then that went a little further down\n[HIGHWAY NAME], like a Freez-ett, which is a Dairy Queen, nowadays, those kinds of things, but\nmainly still just homes. And that's the only homes there were, was just in that small area that was\naround town."

So when ED, they started in there in the Government Center had everybody had a\ncloset or something for an office. And so you were familiar with what they were there the reason for\nbeing here, the concerns that they had about choosing the proper businesses for us. And I think along\nthe reason [COMMUNITY NAME] has grown as much if not more than the cities around here is they put\neverything in line as they needed it. And they had the knowledge and the information. And if they didn't\nhave it, they, they looked for it, uh, out to other cities that were about our size that were having this kind\nof growth spurt, you know, it wasn't just as deciding, if they took their information to and said \"Hmm,\nokay, maybe we need to think about different things.\" And Fire, Fire and Police are definitely going to\nhave to be beefed up when you start having more people. And so, that's another thing that always got\nhandled, was Fire and Police has to be be-beefed up. So they were always a concern. Of course you, I\nused to answer the phone all the time and somebody will say \"Can you send the Street Department out\nto so and so and so and so?\" And I said, \"Ma'am, we have two people in the Street Department. Uh, I, I\ndoubt if those two people are going to be able, maybe I can get in touch with some of them to get in\ntouch with you and see what the issues are that you're having, and they can advise you.\" But you know,\nit's not that we have a lot of people that work for us. Uh, but the city is always here to answer your\nquestions, but, uh, we don't have the people. People wanted to know where our snow shovels were,\nyou know, when it snows, which it snows here, it usually doesn't snow even in a year. It might, but it\ndoesn't. So no, we don't have snow shovels. We use bulldozers because that's all we got is that. We\ncan use them for other things. Otherwise, that snow mach-machine would be sitting on the corner over\nthere. Bu, uh, yes, we have, they had the peace of mind and the, the knowledge to see, these are\nmachines that, these are what we need to purchase, because they can not only be, have to be used by\nstreet, our Parks Department could use those, you know. Occasionally some of the other departments\nmight need something that we could use that machine for. So it was a share. Everything got shared,\nand I guess it still does, I don't know."

It could have been, I knew about the city because I was born and raised\nhere. So I think I was an advocate for the city. And what happened before, my boss used to say, come\nto me occasionally, because he's wasn't from here. Uh, he was from [DIFFERENT NORTH TEXAS\nREGION COMMUNITY NAME], and he would say \"So in the olden days\", and I would say, \"Are you\ncalling me old?\", and he goes, \"No, in the days before I got here, you know, how did so and so, how did\nthis happen? Or how did you, how did y'all handle this?\" I felt like sometimes when we were small city\nhall, I answered a lot of the, the day to day needs that people had. I was, my extension was 1010, I was\nthat person that had been here all their life, and if you want to know, if you'll call me, I'll, I'll find out the\nanswer for you. I like people. I, I don't know what I would, if you put me in a room the rest of my life, I\ndo not think I would be happy. I like to visit with people, I like to talk to people I like to see where they're\nfrom, what their concerns are. Sometimes you don't want to hear some of their concerns because\nthere's no way you can make things see or heal like some huge, huge city with a bunch more people\nthan we are. We have to dealing with what our population is and what we can do for our population.\nWe're not 150,000 people. we're more like 50,000. So, uh, you have to constantly remember, you may\nhave came from a larger city here. You may not have everything available to you that you had in a\nlarger city. But it could be coming, and that's a good idea, so you want to keep those things. I used to\nhave a thing written down about strange calls and things you might need and stuff like that, and I kept it\nfor years and I gave it to somebody when I retired up here, I don't know if they continue that. But I\nalways thought it was, uh, for instance. I think it was a second day I was here and I worked in Utility\nBilling. The phone rang, and of course, anything there to do with the phone was always me anyway,\nand I answered the phone, and this lady said, \"Are the Mustang grapes ripe yet?\" I didn't say anything\nfor a second, I said \"Ma'am, you've reached the Water Department for the City of [COMMUNITY\nNAME].\" \"Yes, I know. Are the Mustang grapes ripe yet?\" So I had an older lady, I told you everybody\nworked in that same area. \"Hold on, please.\" I put her on hold. The lady, she's, I had, I went to school\nwith her daughter. She worked in accoun-, she was the accounting person. And I said \"Wilma, I have\nthis lady just asking me are the ripe, what, Mustang grapes ready yet? And she goes \"Yeah, tell them\nthey are, I went by there this morning. They are so.\" \"Yes, ma'am, Mustang grapes are are ready now.\"\nAnd obviously, I didn't know that. They grew on vines. Where the big towers, we have all these huge\ntowers here. Uh, on the outside of the fences, where the towers are, and they allowed people to come\nget them and make jelly out of them. I didn't know that. So then I learned a new thing. You learn\nsomething new every day too when you work somewhere like this, where you talk to different people. I\nlike that though."

What are we going to, we need a desk.\" And I would go see how big a place we had for them,\nwhat would fit in that place.

And I thought, \"This is me and my chance to get my foot in the door. And maybe I will be there\nif there's a full time position that stays, then I will be able to stay and work in this city where my child is.\"\nNow, my parents lived across the street, and where I grew up, so it wasn't far for me to even visit with\nmy child if I wanted to.

But at night, if you were still here at council, or something, and it got late,\nI got the last parking place in the back of the back of the back of the parking lot, and one day, one night,\nthe next morning, I come in and I asked my boss, I said, \"There were these little eyes, looking at me\nfrom the bushes, and I was terrified.\" And he goes, \"Oh, they're foxes. They're the little foxes. And I\nthink there's some new ones that were back there, I see that too.\" And I thought, \"Well, you know, I'll\ntake your word for it, but I'm not really sure I'm happy with the wildlife, you know, that close, and I'm\nsitting there, the only car in the parking lot sometimes in two or three parts. That's it. And so it was kind\nof scary [LAUGHS]. But the days were long, and if they were short, that was a blessing. If you had to be\ngone, there was always somebody that could do it, you know, that would volunteer say \"I'll do it. Don't\nworry, you go-\", you know.

I felt like she should be able to live here, and somebody should be\nable to help her understand what that meant. I think that's more true nowadays, that there's more\npeople to help them when you don't speak English.

There are kids nowadays, this, this little boy or\nsomething wasn't being mistreated, but he felt like he was, you know, and this one little first grader\nlooked at me and she goes \"That's just wrong.\" And I thought [LAUGHS], I think they're smarter than\nthey used to be.

It's a short made up\nstory about life in Texas that was created in the 1980s. And since then, linguistic researchers have\nrecorded a few 100 Texans reading it. They use these recordings as samples of people's standard way\nof speaking as they try to track how speech in Texas varies and changes over time. This is optional, but\nwould you like to read the passage"
