You know, he has community first and everything that he does, and I watch a lot of the council meetings and stuff online whenever they're having them. And uh I think that he is a big reason why everything is the way it is. Because a lot of people will developers want to move in here, and they just grabbed the land and, and try to build these, these condos and stuff like that. And he's like, no, no, no, no, you know, but let's put the brakes on that a little bit. You know, instead of building 30 houses, let's put five or 10, you know, and then more brick work, you know, so that so that it doesn't become just all brand new housing, they like to preserve a lot of the history, you know, and stuff like that.

Now [COMMUNITY NAME] always had kind of a little downtown area that kind of looks like something from Mayberry or something, you know. And if you went into [NEARBY COMMUNITY NAME] and stuff, you really didn't know where downtown was. I mean, there was some shops over here and stuff like that. And so a lot of them have kind of tried to recreate that whole downtown feeling so that they can have people come out on the Fourth of July and they have a meeting place where they can come and listen to music and bring their children and learn more about the city and everything. So I think that a lot of people have tried to duplicate what's been going done here. But the other thing is, is that with us having the tax base from the uh airport, and from uh Great Wolf Lodge and from Gaylord and all these hotels and everything the Other cities are more bedroom communities, they don't have that big a tax base. And so they're, they want to do this, but they don't really have the funds to do it with because I mean, yeah, you know, they've got a lot of houses and stuff like that. But those are more like bedroom communities. And so they struggle with trying to keep up with what's going, going on here. "

Well, there's a service that they have that'll do that. It's called Meals on Wheels. Well, the Meals on Wheels, people said, you know, we'll bring meals to your house if you need that. And but people were still coming up here and getting their meals and leaving. And so they had to cut that off. And they said no. We want people to come up here and sit down and talk and enjoy an hour away from the house. So they can you know, converse mingle, whatever you call it, tell jokes, whatever you want to do, you know, we want people to get out and get together and I felt at first I thought you know, well that's kind of kind of hard because you're going to cut off a lot of people at home but they didn't do that they just offered them a different program. And uh they wanted to get as many people just to come up here and sit and do what they do. And they have a volunteer program that runs it, they have uh people that volunteer to make the desserts on a daily basis. And then they have uh young kids or teens or whatever, they come up here, uh service league and stuff like that. And they they bring in the whole community. "

And when they promote, they promote from within a lot of the people that are here that are you know, they've been here for a year, one guy been here eight years and he's moving on to a better job within the rec, you know, so they uh, they get good people that are good at what they do.

And then I was retired early so that I could be with my mother more because she was she's 104 right now. So at that time, I think she was 103 and I just wanted to spend more time with her. And so I retired early, a little earlier than 70. I think our what our 68 is when I retired like two years ago and when I retired I spent a lot of time with her, and uh she's a little bit less mobile now than what she was. And we did spend a lot of time together the first year. And then it's kind of dropping off a little bit because she's kind of losing her health and her hearing and her sight and stuff like that. But uh a lot of when I first retired us a lot of that revolve around her, and asking her questions about her childhood, and our relatives, and trying to get all that stuff lined up. And then eh she was in an apartment living by herself. And so I can go over there and visit her while she moved out of our apartment, because she was kind of getting to where she needed somebody to be around her all the time. So my sister and brother both have room in their houses. And so she spends her time at both locations. So now she's not only with me, but she's with my sisters part time, and she's with my brother part time. But after that dropped off, I mean, we had a lot of discussions, and she had asked me, you know, what do you do, and I told her, Well, they've got this program at the Senior Center, she goes, \"Man, if I had that I'd be done on top of that\", you know, she's said, \"That's a deal.\" She said, \"$5 for a meal, and then get to talk with people.\" She goes, \"I bet you start going to that, I bet you meet some people that you really like.\" And uh Mom was right again. And the thing is, I just, if I didn't have something like that to do, besides hanging out with the guys down here and working once a week, or maybe once every two weeks, uh it gets me up and gets me go on, I've got something to do, I gotta go to the Rec and eat lunch. And then after that, I've met some people. And I'm like, you want to go down to a park and walk around, or you want to go down into a mall or do some shopping or something like that. So I've met a lot of people and it gets you going. And uh it's like that first task of the day, even though it's around noon, you know, I get up, I get ready, or go to lunch. And then from there, go to a movie or, or make plans for that evening, or just meet up with people. "

When I first moved out here, we moved out here because we really enjoyed the lake. And we bought a boat. And uh I had uh was hooked up with a girl and we later got married, and she had a child from a previous marriage. And uh he was uh real young as four or five years old when we moved out here, and uh we just enjoyed going to the lake and camping. We went camping every weekend, and we had friends that would meet up and camp with and, and we did everything revolved around being in the water. And on the boats. I mean, we go down to the Brazos River and stuff like that, but, but initially, we came out here so that we could be close to the lake. Because if you live in a town and [NEARBY COMMUNITY NAME] or whatever, and you got to pack up all your boat, and your camping supplies, and everything, and then go to the lake and get gas and ice and all that stuff. And then you got to drag all that stuff back home 20, 30 miles back home to [NEARBY COMMUNITY NAME] or whatever, if you're in [COMMUNITY NAME]. I mean, you just got everything in the boat, you come home from work, you just jump in, and you're in the lake in 15 minutes. And so a lot of people didn't come out during the week, and we like to go out. Because we were big in the water skiing. We liked it when there wasn't a lot of people around. And so uh we'd go out during the week. And then on the weekends, we'd go camping, and instead of skiing so much. But uh we had a really good times this five or six year old kid turned out to be a really good water skier. And he was acting out in school because I guess I don't know being a stepchild or whatever and single not having brothers and sisters to compete with and everything and, and so I just kind of took him on under my sleeve, our own or my wing. And me and him we're going every weekend, we were going out to these tournaments, is can and meeting all these older guys. And when you you meet these guys, and they're like in their shorts down at the lake, they're just guys, and you're just talking skin and everything. And then later on. \"So Michaels, where did you know that guy who was president of bank one?\" And you're like, \"Why then?\" And then you know another guy, they say, \"Oh, yeah, he's a pilot all of a 747 out of DFW.\" And I was like, \"Really,\" and they're talking to my son, like they talked to me, you know, \"Hey, man, you had a pretty good run today.\" And they're sitting over there chatting. And I'm like, you know, he doesn't understand that that's like the CEO of of Fidelity, you know. And so it kind of dropped all the borders, that you could meet people and be on their level. And they like they liked it that way. I mean, they didn't come in with a big chip on their shoulder or anything. Everybody was equal when they were down by the lake. But I think the time that I spent with him was well invested. He grew up to be a good kid, he did have some rough times. And he's, uh he's learned his lessons very well. And I'm really proud of the person that he became. "

And he opened it up to the first page, and there was a full size picture of George. Yeah, I go that's him. They go, \"Oh, that's the CEO, or whatever you want me to call him? And we'll have you go and meet with him?\" And I was like, No, I don't think so [CHUCKLES]. So the next time I saw him, he was having a party out at his house. And he invited us out. And it was overlooking some big horse farm and stuff like that. And he was just as neat a guy you can imagine. But, you know, he drove a little Subaru. And he really wasn't a real flashy guy, or anything. And it was it was pretty unique how, how people are. So they're in positions like that. But yet, they're, they're so easy to talk to and "

One of the things that I had suggested that ask every year they put out a survey and ask you, you know, how do you like things? How are things going? And what would you like to see added to it and everything? My only comment was, as I thought that they ought to do interviews with the elders of the community, which is what exactly was what you're doing, you know, and I said, you could just take someone, most of the people that are up here are widows, most of the husbands have died, and they're widows, but they have a story to tell, you know, and I would like to see it, that they get these stories before they're gone. You know, they, if they could get them just to agree to a question and answer type thing and, and just make it as casual as possible. But then the record that for all everyone to hear from here on out, and they don't have to be long, punctual stories, it can be just funny things that happen to them or things that they will remember, just little things, because you know that I think it'd be a lot of fun, because I mean, everybody has something unique about and then the other thing to do would be the interaction from the other people, if you have them up in front of them, you know, people are like asking \"I remember you\" [LAUGHS], you know, to get them involved in it, too, because, you know, I think everybody would would be interested in hearing the, the history, and uh I think it should be preserved. "

And when I was younger, and I mean I hitchhiked around the United States by myself, you know, and uh I uh, you know, hitchhiked and if I knew somebody in Colorado, you know, and I didn't have a, I just get on the road and put thumb out and start meeting people and catching car rides. And you know, I had sleeping bag, I could sleep well on the side of the road. And I did this a number of times because I worked for an airline one time, and they would fly me out to the West Coast for free. And then I could hitchhike from like San Francisco down to uh Monterey, or, or Big Sur, or any of those kind of like hippie hangout type things. And uh I went all around the country hitchhiking, and uh I just don't remember ever having money. I just don't even remember buying anything. I just, I just, I don't even remember having a wallet. You know, people are like, oh, \"Somebody could have, you know, took your money.\" And I said, \"I don't think I had any money.\" You know, I mean what are you going to get out of somebody that doesn't have it. But I guess it was just those times where you just, uh you know, people would just help you out the best. I don't remember. You know, I don't remember being hungry. I don't remember being thirsty. I don't remember having money. But I just remember meeting a lot of very nice people. And people people are like, \"By yourself?\" and I'm like, \"Yes.\" They said, \"That's pretty brave.\" I said \"It wasn't be brave.\" And it's just what we did you know. And in fact, one time in the 70s, I uh had a job where I could uh friend of mine, they make custom vans, and they give us 50 bucks to deliver them. And they would have us drive to Chicago for like 50 bucks, you know. And so I flew up uh, drove a van up there and uh they bought me a plane ticket back and I flew into DFW and I didn't even have a quarter for a payphone. I didn't have any money. And I'd never been to DFW it had just opened at like six months before. And so I got there and I didn't have any money to call on a payphone. So I tried to walk out, so I just went out the door and started walking. And there was no sidewalks. And I was like, \"Whoa, you know, there's a big road over there.\" So I went around a couple of fences and through a couple of gates and I ended up on the main thoroughfare and I was sitting out there hitchhiking and and then this uh uh officer came by and started asking me questions. And he said, \"You can't hitchhike on a toll road.\" And I was like, \"What toll road?\" He said, \"You're on a toll road.\" He said, \"How did you get here?\" And I'll say, \"One of those big planes.\" And he said, \"Have you ever been here before?\" And I said, \"No.\" He said, \"Well, you can't do that.\" So he picked me up. He took me out to the uh toll booth where the toll road ended and dropped me off. And then I was able to get out of there. But I was like, Well, that explains why there's no sidewalks [LAUGHS]. "

I mean, we my mom and my sister spent a lot of time together. So my dad spent most of the time with the boys. And he would uh on the weekends when he was not working. We would go out on Sunday hikes and go back in the woods and he would take us up to places that he grew up in and show us things out in nature, you know, and stuff like that, and uh, and take us around to different things like that. But we were always in uh swim classes or dance classes or exercise classes. My mom kept us busy with all that kind of stuff. But I don't remember doing chores very much at all. I never did like laundry or or had to uh clean dishes or anything like that. "

And if you're in a remote area, and it just, you know, if, if nobody's checking on you, I mean, it could be days before anybody realized that if you fall in the bathtub or whatever, I mean, my mom lived in a community and a guy fell in a bathtub, and he was there for four days before they ever found him. And then she had a neighbor that like committed suicide. I don't know, she had some mental issues. But they didn't even I mean, police came out and they said, \"Oh, we can't get the door doors locked. We can't go in there,\" you know. And my mom had to go up to the people and tell them, \"Something's wrong. There's UPS packages and stuff. She's not answering her door, she won't answer phone and her car hasn't move, something's going on.\" So they finally went back and knocked the door in and she was she was dead. But uh it's just sad that uh you know you can't be able to get things caught. And it made me realize that this is a type of community that I want to be in, I want to be, I want to be close to medical facilities, and uh I want to be close to whatever, whatever else makes me happy. And this is the place to be because I'm happy.  "

One of the over arching research questions about this home to Texas program is about linguistic changes in Texas, I already noticed that you kind of have a Texan drawl. So this will be pretty good. So as part of this project, linguistic researcher is asking that interview participants to read a brief passage, which will only take about a couple of minutes. It's a short made up story about a life in Texas that was created in the 1980s. And then, linguistic researchers have recorded a few 100 other Texans reading it over time. And they're trying to use these recordings as samples to find out people's standard way of speaking so that they can track how speech in Texas varies and changes over time. There is a reading passage right here, would you be willing to read it out loud for the morning. And then the way you read it, just read it as if you know you're just telling the story to your younger child about your childhood and how you came to be in like the most natural way that feels most natural to you. Whenever you're ready. "

And when I was five, we moved to a farm near White House, which is southeast of taller I like growing up in the country. When my chores are done, I'd ride my horse, climb trees or hike down to the creek to fish or swim. One time we taught a rope to the limb of a cypress tree and we swung out over the swimming hole and drop in the water. I'd pretend to be Tarzan swinging on a vine in the spring flight kites and on summer nights we'd watch fireflies but we call them lightning bugs. Once on a wall would have fights with corncobs or pine cones in the winter would build a bar and a fireplace and pop pop pop popcorn and roast peanuts and pecans. I guess it was a live wire when I was 19 I went to work in Dallas at a Firestone Tire store. I didn't like city life for a long time I go home every chance I got mama would always cook my favorite foods fried okra hoppin john that's rice and black eyed peas and pecan pie. We had lots of good times what were but going home is not the same. Now after daddy died, Mama sold the farm and moved taller. I'd rather be living in a farm right now instead of here in a city but my wife and kids don't understand me. I grew up about city life and talk about moving to the country. My oldest child says Daddy, that's crazy. I just die if I had to live on a farm almost cried the first time he said that. I know Texas is changing. But I want to make sure we don't lose touch with our roots. While we may have live in a city, I want my kids to have a good feeling for the land and have a sense of place and take pride in being Texans. If they lose our toss to the lamb. The price of progress is too high. "
