I've lived in Texas all my life. I was born in Titus County. And when I was five, we moved to a farm near White House, which is southeast of Tyler. I like growing up in the country. When my chores were done, I'd ride my horse, climb trees or hike down to the creek to fish or swim. One time we tied a rope to a limb of a cypress tree, and we'd swing out wide over the swimming hole and drop\ninto the water. I'd pretend to be Tarzan swinging on a vine. In the Spring, I'd fly kites and on summer nights we watch we'd catch butter. Catch fireflies, excuse me. But we call them lightning bugs. Once in a while we'd have fights with corn cobs or pine cones. In the winter we build a fire in the fireplace and pop popcorn and roast peanuts and pecans. I guess I was a Livewire. When I was 19, I went to work in\nDallas at a Firestone Tire store. I didn't like city life, and for a long time I'd go home every chance I got. Mama would always cook my favorite foods. fried okra hopping, John. That's rice and black eyed peas and pecan pie. We had lots of good times, but going home is not the same now. After daddy died, Mama sold the farm and moved to Tyler. I'd rather be living on a farm right now instead of here in the city. But my wife and kids don't understand me when I gripe about city life and talk about moving to the country. My eldest child says, Daddy, that's crazy. I'd just die if I have to live on a farm. I almost cried the first time she said that. I know Texas is changing. But I tried to make sure we don't lose touch with our roots.
