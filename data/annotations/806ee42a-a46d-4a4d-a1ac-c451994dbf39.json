I like growing up in the country. When my chores were done, I'd ride my horse, climb trees or hike down to the creek to fish or swim. One time we tied a rope to a limb of a cypress tree, and we'd swing out wide over the swimming hole and drop\ninto the water. I'd pretend to be Tarzan swinging on a vine. In the Spring, I'd fly kites and on summer nights we watch we'd catch butter. Catch fireflies, excuse me. But we call them lightning bugs. Once in a while we'd have fights with corn cobs or pine cones. In the winter we build a fire in the fireplace and pop popcorn and roast peanuts and pecans. I guess I was a Livewire. When I was 19, I went to work in\nDallas at a Firestone Tire store. I didn't like city life, and for a long time I'd go home every chance I got. Mama would always cook my favorite foods. fried okra hopping, John. That's rice and black eyed peas and pecan pie. We had lots of good times, but going home is not the same now. After daddy died, Mama sold the farm and moved to Tyler. I'd rather be living on a farm right now instead of here in the city. But my wife and kids don't understand me when I gripe about city life and talk about moving to the country. My eldest child says, Daddy, that's crazy. I'd just die if I have to live on a farm. I almost cried the first time she said that. I know Texas is changing. But I tried to make sure we don't lose touch with our roots. While we may live in a city, I want my kids to have a good feeling for the land, have a sense of place and take pride in being Texans. If they if they lose our ties to the land, the price of progress is too high."

One of the overarching research questions through the home to Texas\nprogram is about linguistic changes in Texas. As part of this project, a linguistic researcher is asking\nthat interview participants read a brief passage, which should only take a couple of minutes. It's a short\nmade up story about life in Texas that was created in the 1980s. And since then, linguistic researchers\nhave recorded a few 100 Texans reading it. They use these recordings as samples of people's\nstandard way of speaking as they try to track how speech in Texas varies and changes over time. So\nthank you again for being one of those participants in that. And that concludes the stuff on the guide.\nBut is there anything else that you would like to add about community or as your position as a librarian\nor anything?"
