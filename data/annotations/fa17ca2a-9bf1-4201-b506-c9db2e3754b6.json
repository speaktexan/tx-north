But [CLEARS THROAT] when, when you say\nwhen somebody asks who you work for, they recognize it. It's televised, it's gotten radio commercial.\nBut um, and people are pretty excited. One thing about delivering a pods container if you've never seen\nthe process. I'll give you a quick example. We have, pods are delivered on a truck with a lift system\nthat's called Podzilla, and uh the pod sits on top of the Podzilla. When we deliver it, we raise it up, pull\nthe truck out from under it and we can maneuver the Podzilla and it goes 360. A lot of people didn't\nknow that. So one of the more interesting instances was I delivered to a woman that was probably in\nher late 20s. And she just thought as a lot of people do, the truck just go straight up in the back. So I\npull the truck out in the street, turned it 90 degrees and put it in the driveway. She was so amazed, and\nwhen she filled it up, and I came back a week later to pick up her container, she had three of her\nneighborhood girlfriends in lawn chairs, umbrella drinks, waiting to see the pods."

I just have one last request for you before we conclude our interview. So one of the\noverarching research questions through the Home to Texas program is about linguistic changes in\nTexas. So as part of this project, a linguistic researcher is asking that interview participants read a brief\npassage, which should only take a couple of minutes. It's a short made up story about life in Texas that\nwas created in the 1980s. And since then, linguistic researchers have recorded a few 100 Texans\nreading it. They use these recordings as samples of people standard way of speaking as they try to\ntrack how speech in Texas varies and changes over time. Would you be willing to read a brief\npassage?"

And\nwhen I was five, we moved to a farm near White House, which is southeast of Tyler. I like growing up in\nthe country. When my chores were done, I'd ride my horse, climb trees, or hike down the creek to fish\nor swim. One time we tied a rope to a limb with a cypress tree and we'd swing out wide over the\nswimming hole and drop into the water. I'd pretend to be Tarzan swinging on a vine. In the spring, I'd fly\nkites and on summer nights we'd catch fireflies but we'd call them lightning bugs. Once in a while we'd\nhave fights with corn cobs or pine cones. In the winter we'd be able to fire in the fireplace and pop\npopcorn and roast peanuts and popcorn. Pecans. I'm sorry. I guess I was a live wire. When I was 19 I\nwent to work in Dallas at a Firestone Tire store. I didn't like city life and for a long time I'd go home\nevery chance I got. Mama would always cook my favorite foods , fried okra, hopping John, that's rice\nand black eyed peas, and pecan pie. We had lots of good times, but going home is not the same now.\nAfter daddy died, Mama sold the farm and moved to Tyler. I'd rather be living on a farm right now\ninstead of here in the city. But my wife and kids don't understand me when I gripe about city life and\ntalk about moving to the country. My oldest child says, Daddy, that's crazy, I just die if I had to live on a\nfarm. I almost cried the first time she said that. I know Texas is changing but I tried to make sure we\ndon't lose touch with our roots. While we may live in a city, I want my kids to have a good feeling for the\nland, have a sense of place and take pride in being Texans. If they lose our ties to the land, the price of\nprogress is too high."
