Before we conclude our interview. One of the\noverarching research questions through the home to Texas program is about linguistic changes in\nTexas. As part of the project a linguistic researcher is asking. The interview participants read a brief\nmessage which should only take a couple of minutes is a short made up story about life in Texas that\nwas created in the 1980s. And since then, linguistic researchers have recorded a few 100 Texans\nreading it. They use these recordings as samples of people centered way of speaking as they try to\ntrack how speech in Texas varies and changes over time. Would you be willing to read a brief passage\nout loud? Okay, great. Thank you so much. Whenever you're ready, could you please lead this out\nloud."

              "text": "I've lived in Texas all my life. I was born in Titus County. And when I was five, we moved to a farm near\nWhite House, which is southeast of Tyler. I liked growing up in the country where my chores were done.\nI ride my horse and climb trees or hike down to the creek to fish or swim. One time we tied a rope to a\nlimb of a cypress tree and we swing out wide over the swimming hole and drop into the water. I pretend\nto be Tarzan swinging on a vine. In the spring. I'd fly kites in on summer nights we'd catch fireflies, but\nwe call them lightning bugs. Once in a while, we'd have fights with corn cobs and pine cones. In the\nwinter we build a fire in the fireplace and pop popcorn and roast peanuts and pecans. I guess I was a\nlive wire. When I was 19 I went to work in Dallas at a Firestone Tire store. I don't like city life. And for a long time I go home every chance I got mama would always cook my favorite foods fried okra hopping John. That's the that's the rice. That's rice and black eyed peas and pecan pie. We had lots of good times, but going home is not the same now. After daddy died, Mama sold the farm and moved to Tyler.\nI'd rather be living on a farm right now instead of here in the city. But my wife and kids don't understand\nme when I gripe about city life and talk about moving to the country. My oldest child says Daddy, that's\ncrazy. I just die of I had to live on a farm. I almost cried the first time she said that. I know Texas is\nchanging but but I tried to make sure we don't lose touch with our roots. While we may live in a city, I\nwant my kids to have a good feeling for the land. Have a sense of place and take pride in being a\nTexan. If they lose if they lose our ties to the land the price of progress is too high."
